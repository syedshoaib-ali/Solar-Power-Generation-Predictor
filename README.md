# Solar-Power-Generation-Predictor
Solar energy output prediction using optimized XGBoost regression with scaled environmental features and an interactive Streamlit UI.

Machine Learning Regression Project using XGBoost & Streamlit
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts solar energy generation (in Joules per 3-hour period) using environmental parameters such as:

Distance to solar noon

Temperature

Sky cover

Visibility

Humidity

Wind speed

The goal is to build a highly accurate regression model, visualize insights through EDA, and provide a Streamlit-based web application for real-time predictions.
